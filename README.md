MaaS provides convenient access to the [Safaricom MPESA Daraja API](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/apis-explorer) for Developers, Tech Ethusiasts, Companies and Corporates. MaaS makes this possible by making all the API's available on Daraja accessible as a Service. The platform also offers a Dashboard to monitor your activity on Daraja, an Android SDK and Webhooks configurations to hook it to your own system with ease! Itâ€™s easy. We promise. :rocket:

> MaaS does not replace Daraja in any way, but offer a managed access to Daraja for FREE!
